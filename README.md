# Progressively Enhanced Data Viz with Remix

This is a demonstration of how to progressively enhance a data visualization!

The core idea can be seen by doing the following:

1. Run `npm i && npm run setup && npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the [invoices page](http://localhost:3000/sales/invoices/)
3. Switch between invoices and notice the graph animates (you may need to add a few invoices first)
4. Disable JS and switch between invoices: the graph should show up but no longer animate

## Where did I get the code?

The vast majority of this code comes from Kent C. Dodd's wonderful [advanced-remix](https://github.com/kentcdodds/advanced-remix/tree/main/final/08-skeletons) codebase, which has a nice demo Remix app.
